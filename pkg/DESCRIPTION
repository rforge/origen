Description: This package primarily estimates allele frequency surfaces from point estimates.  It can also place individuals of unknown origin back onto the map with great accuracy.  Additionally, it can place admixed individuals by estimating contributing fractions at each location on a map. Lastly, it can rank SNPs by their ability to differentiate populations.  See "Fast Spatial Ancestry via Flexible Allele Frequency Surfaces" (John Michael Ranola, John Novembre, Kenneth Lange) in Bioinformatics 2014 for more info.

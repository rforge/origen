Description: Used primarily for estimates of allele frequency surfaces from point estimates.  
    It can also place individuals of unknown origin back onto the geographic map with great accuracy.  
    Additionally, it can place admixed individuals by estimating contributing fractions at each
    location on a map. Lastly, it can rank SNPs by their ability to differentiate populations.  
    See "Fast Spatial Ancestry via Flexible Allele Frequency Surfaces" (John Michael Ranola, John
    Novembre, Kenneth Lange) in Bioinformatics 2014 for more info.
